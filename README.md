# 8x8queens
Task: Write a program that places 8 queens on an 8x8 board where none of the queens are in conflict with each other.  You are to implement the solution by using the hill-Climbing algorithm with random restarts.

Details:
Java version: 17.0.1

 
Steps:
1.  Create an 8x8 map to begin
2. Using the Random import, randomize the map
3. Next, find conlficts in: columns rows and diagnolally. 
3a. If it is not in goal state, meaning conflict exists, evaluate all of the possible neighbor states by moving each columnâ€™s queen (called the moveQueen method) through the rows of its column and generating a heuristic value for each of those states.
4. Once we know the neighbor states, we compare heurisitc value and see if any states have a lower one - if a better was not found, we reached the local minima and perform random start. 
4a. If compared and found a lower heuristic value, then that becomes the current state. 
5. Step 4 is repeated until no lower value is found.
